This directory contains an example to show how to use the tangram 
to detect the MEI from MOSAIK aligned bam files. Please unzip the
"example.tar.gz" file first: > tar -zxvf example.tar.gz

Files
=======================================

1. chr20_simu_5x_1m.bam: this is a MOSAIK aligned bam file with 20 
                         simulated ALU insertions (homozygous) with 
                         5X coverage. It is sorted by coordinates 
                         and indexed (chr20_simu_5x_1m.bam.bai).

2. chr20_repeat_mask*.bed: These files contain the coordinates of
                           referenced mobile elements on chr20.
                           They will be used as filters.

3. key_1m.txt: This files contains the coordinates of the simulated
               insertions.

4. bam_list_example.txt: This is an example file of an input bam list
                         for Tangram (tangram_detect and tangram_scan). 
                         Each entry of the file should be a path
                         to a bam file. You should change the path
                         in the example list to the real path.

5. mask_list_example.txt: This is an example file of input mask list for
                          tangram_filter.pl (--msk). Each entry of the 
                          file contain the type of mask, window size and
                          the path to the mask. You should change the path
                          in the example to the real path.


Detection Pipeline
=======================================

Note: all the command is run in $TANGRAM_HOME/bin.

1. You need to download the human reference file for the 1000G ftp site:
   ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/hs37d5.fa.gz
   and unzip the file to the "$TANGRAM_HOME/data" directory. The special 
   reference file is already included in the "$TANGRAM_HOME/data"
   (moblist_19Feb2010_sequence_length60.fa).

2. Change the path in the bam_list_example.txt and mask_list_example.txt 
   to the real path in your computer.

3. Index the reference: 

> ./tangram_index -ref <path_to_human_ref> -sp <path_to_special_ref> -out <indexed_ref>

4. Fragment length distribution: 

> ./tangram_scan -in <path_to_bam_list> -dir <output_dir>

Note that this output directory must be empty or non-existing 
(tangram_scan will create one for you). After scanning, you 
should find two build files in the output directory: "lib_table.dat" 
and "hist.dat". These two files are the input for tangram_detect.

5. Call MEI events and filtering: 

> ./tangram_detect -lb <path_to_lib_table.dat> -ht <path_to_hist.dat> \
-in <path_to_bam_list> -rg 20 -ref <path_to_indexed_ref>              \
| ./tangram_filter.pl --vcf stdin --msk <path_to_mask_list>
